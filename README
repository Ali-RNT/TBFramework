#Tarna Bot Framework
This project implements Telegram Bot API in Qt, and much more! Watch this project to stay updated on new features.

##Tutorial
This library currently just works with getUpdates method. Using it is pretty easy, create an instance of TarnaBot, move it to a thread
and connect its run method to QThread`s started signal. To process incoming updates, just connect updateReceived signal to a handler class.

This wrapper has no especial feature currently and is under development! Don`t expect it big jobs, and use it only for testing purposes.
It`s highly unstable currently.

To get a better understanding of how it works, take a look at examples directory.
